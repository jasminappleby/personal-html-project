<p>This example is about linking different pages together.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first type of link is a listed absolute link, like to
      <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
         target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good
         resource for web developers.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Then you have regular links that are not listed, such as: </p>

  <p>My LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmin-appleby-holdham-67150814b/">LinkedIn </a> which can be placed anywhere within a text. This is useful to source websites.</p>

  <p>This is an inhouse link to my CV page, you should be able to naviagte back from this page: <a href='jasminscv.html'>Jasmin's CV.</a></p>
